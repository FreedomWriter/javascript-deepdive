# Minimize Images

- If you want transparency: use a PNG
- If you want animations: use a GIF
- If you want colorful images: use a JPG
- If you want simple icons, logos, and illustrations, use SVGs
- Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
- Reduce JPG wth JPEG-optimizer
- Try to choose simple illustrations over highly detailed photographs
- Always lower JPEG image quality (30-60%)
- Resize image based on size it will be displayed - if the images is 1000px but you're only displaying it at 500px, resize the image!
- Display different sized images for different backgrounds (use medial queries)
- Use CDNs (content delivery network) like imigx
- Remove image metadata - www.verexif.com/en/inddex.php does this meta data often includes gps coordinates and other info, not just good to remove for performance, but also for privacy
