What is a Data Structure?
    a collection of values that can have relationships among them and can have functions applied to them
    each one is different in what it can do and what it is best used for
    each one is specialized for it's own thing

How do computers store data?
    CPU
        connected to the memory controlled which does the reading and writing to RAM
        build in speed boosts to access things stored closer together in RAM
        CPU cahce is a small amount of membory that the CPU has which stores a copy of very recient things
    RAM
        stores varaibles - not persistant
        faster than storage
        Stores things in `addresses` which hold 8 bits, which is one byte
    Storage
        references persitent memory
        slower than RAM
