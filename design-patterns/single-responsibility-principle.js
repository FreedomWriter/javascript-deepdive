/* 

There is an anti-pattern that stands in opposition to the Single Responsibliity Principle, which is the God Object. The God Object is basically a huge object that has a ton of responsibliities.

that makes debugging really difficult. Single Responsibility Principle feels closely connected to "seperation of concerns"
